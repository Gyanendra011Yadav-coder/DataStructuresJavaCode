 * IN THIS, WE WILL BE FNDING THE LOWEST COMMON ANCESTOR OF THE GIVEN NODES.
 * Ancestors
 * PrepBuddy is researching about different kinds of mammals and their ancestors.
 * He has assigned a unique integer number to each mammal and has arranged them in a binary search tree format. He needs your help to create a program that outputs lowest common ancestor of two mammals.
 *
 * Note
 * -You have to complete findLowestAncestor() function, no need to implement the tree.
 * Lowest common ancestor of two node n1 and n2 is the lowest node in the tree that has
 * both n1 and n2 as descendents(where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
