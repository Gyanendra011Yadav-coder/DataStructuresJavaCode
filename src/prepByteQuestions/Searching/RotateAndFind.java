 * Given a rotated array A� and an integer x�, your task is to find the index of x�.
 * Oh! One more thing. Before you start thinking of using linear search let me inform you the array is sorted and rotated.
 *
 *** Input format
 * First line contains an integer T�, number of test cases. Then follows T� test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains N�. Second lines contain N� space separated integers and the third line contains an integer x�
 *
 ***Output format
 * Print T� lines, each containing index of x� in A�. Print −1−1 if x� is not present in the array.
 *
 ***Input
 * 3
 * 9 5 6 7 8 9 10 1 2 3
 * 10
 *
 ***Output
 * 5
