 * Rotate Array in Java
 * You may have been using Java for a while. Do you think a simple Java array question
 * can be a challenge? Letâ€™s use the following problem to test.
 * Problem: Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps. For example, with n
 * = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]. How many different
 * ways do you know to solve this problem?
