 * Vaibhav likes to play with numbers and he has N numbers. One day he was placing the numbers on the playing board just to count that how many numbers he has.
 * He was placing the numbers in increasing order i.e. from 1 to N. But when he was putting the numbers back into his bag, some numbers fell down onto the floor.
 * He picked up all the numbers but one number, he couldn't find. Now he has to go somewhere urgently, so he asks you to find the missing number.

 * NOTE: Don't use Sorting
